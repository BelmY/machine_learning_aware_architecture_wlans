### Project description
Lots of hopes have been placed in Machine Learning (ML) as a key enabler of future wireless networks. By taking advantage of the large volumes of data generated by networks, ML is expected to deal with the ever-increasing complexity of networking problems. Unfortunately, current networking systems are not yet prepared for supporting the ensuing requirements of ML-based applications, especially for enabling procedures related to data collection, processing, and output distribution. This article points out the architectural requirements that are needed to pervasively include ML as part of future wireless networks operation. To this aim, we propose to adopt the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) unified architecture for 5G and beyond. Specifically, we look into Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs), which, due to their nature, can be found in multiple forms, ranging from cloud-based to edge-computing-like deployments. Based on the ITU's architecture, we provide insights on the main requirements and the major challenges of introducing ML to the multiple modalities of WLANs.
